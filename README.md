# GWBClarionSortHeader
 A browse sort header template for Clarion Template chain
 
 I wrote this template some time ago and have seldom used it because I seldom use the Clarion template chain.
 
 It is supplied free of charge and without any guarantee of success!
 
 There is a supplied exe with the template in place so you can see how it works without going any further.
